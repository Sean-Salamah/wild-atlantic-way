            <a href="https://thecrollydistillery.com/"><h2>1. Croithlí Distillery Experience: <div class="FoodCounty">(County Donegal)</div></h2></a>
            
            <p>In the Gaeltacht village of Croithlí, County Donegal, in the remote north west corner of Ireland, a remarkable revival is underway. Long before whiskey had its name, Tír Chonaill (Donegal’s traditional Irish name) was already steeped in the spirit-making tradition. In fact, this is where the very story of whiskey everywhere has its roots.</p>

            <p>As early as the 6th century, the monastic community founded in this region by Irish patron saint St Colmcille was distilling herbal tonics and spirits — laying the foundations for what would become Irish whiskey. When he was later exiled to the Scottish island of Iona, St Colmcille took the secret of distillation with him and so the story continued.</p>

            <p>This sacred knowledge of fusing direct fire, pristine water, and superior grain passed through generations in Donegal — from the monks of old to the hillside poitín makers of more recent times. Today, Croithlí Distillery rekindles that spirit. Our artisans have masterfully fused the old ways of using direct fire, copper stills, double distillation, and the purest Donegal water, with a modern twist of creativity to achieve whiskey excellence you’ll find nowhere else.</p>

            <a href="https://www.sligooysterexperience.ie/"><h2>2. Sligo Oyster Experience: <div class="FoodCounty">(County Sligo)</div></h2></a>
            
            <p>Aisling spent years studying and working abroad before returning to her roots and settling in her hometown, Sligo.</p>
            
            <p>When she returned Aisling opened a café named WB’s Coffee House in 2014 located in the premises which used to be the family pub named The Punchbowl opened by her father Kevin in 1968.</p>

            <p>Aisling has very fond memories of there as a child and some of the original features of this pub remain here today. The café is situated across from the famous statue of W.B Yeats in Sligo Town on Stephen St which is where the cafes name originates from.</p>

            <p>It was when Aisling met her now husband Glenn who is an oyster farmer she was first introduced to oysters and it is from here she developed her love for all things oysters! After almost 4 years in business and bringing all her experience on a professional level and her personal connections together Aisling developed the Sligo Oyster Experience in 2018 after spotting a niche in the market.</p>
