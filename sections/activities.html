        <h1>Exciting Activities to part-take at the Wild Atlantic Way</h1>
        <p>While there are endless discovery points along the route, this guide focuses on what I believe are the best stops on the Wild Atlantic Way.

        Some, like Killarney National Park are well known while others, like West Cork’s Sheep’s Head Peninsula, are often missed by visitors to Ireland.</p>

    <h2>The Slieve League Cliffs</h2>
    <p>The Slieve League Cliffs on the coast of Donegal are the highest accessible cliffs in Ireland (the highest cliffs in the country are Croaghaun sea cliffs on Achill).

    The cliffs rise 601m above the Atlantic Ocean and are a spectacular site. The short walk from the main car park to the cliffs takes you past an ‘EIRE’ sign from WWII.

    As you can see from the map above, you can either walk up to them or take a bus from the visitor centre. Just note that it can get quite misty here, which results in the views being completely obscured.</p>

    <h2>Connemara’s Kylemore Abbey</h2>
    <p>Connemara is home to some of the most popular things to do on the Wild Atlantic Way. This is the area along the Atlantic Coast north of Galway City that is known for its incredible natural beauty as well as its strong connections to Irish language and culture.

    The coastline of Connemara is made up of peninsulas, inlets and islands. The area is the largest Gaeltacht region in Ireland with around 22,000 daily Irish speakers living there.

    Connemara National Park is located in the northwest of the region. It encompasses over 2,000 hectares of mountains, bogs and grasslands. Diamond Hill outside of the village of Letterfrack is one of the most popular hikes in the national park.</p>

    <h2>Stargazing in Mayo</h2>
    <p>There’s nothing quite like the night skies in Mayo. When the weather is clear, you’re met with a blanket of twinkling stars and galaxies in the sky overhead, with no light pollution to impede the view. The best place for stargazing is at Mayo Dark Sky Park, set among the wilds of the Nephin Mountains in Ballycroy. In the winter months, they run a weekly guided dark sky walk, so you can take a stroll with an expert guide, who can point out the constellations and planets above.</p>
